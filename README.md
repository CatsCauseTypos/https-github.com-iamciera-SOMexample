Self Organizing Maps (SOM): Example using RNAseq reads

Tutorial is for learning about how to run clustering analysis using Self Organizing Maps using the kohonen package in R.

[part 1](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part1_clean.html): Cleaning EdgeR output for SOM analysis.

[part 2a](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part2a_SOM.html): Running PCA and SOM

[part 2b](html/SOM_RNAseq_tutorial_part2a_SOM.html): Running superSOM

Running Code
-------------

To run examples, please download all files and keep files in the same folders they were downloaded in from the [Github Repository page](https://github.com/iamciera/SOMexample).

New to Githb?: There is a green button that says "clone or download", there is a "download" zip file option here.
